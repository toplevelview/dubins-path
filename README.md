# Dubins curves implemented in Javascript/Typescript for Node.js and the browser
Functions to create Dubins path, which is shortest path of a vehicle constrained by a turn radius.

In 1957, Lester Dubins mathematically proved that the shortest distance between two waypoints (x, y, psi) can be calculated as a combination of straight lines and circular arcs, requiring only three segments.

This code is adapted from the [Python implementation](https://github.com/fgabbert/dubins_py/blob/master/dubins_py.py) by [fgabbert](https://github.com/fgabbert).
